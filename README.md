## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used

- **Spring Boot** ‚Äì For building each individual microservice
- **Spring Cloud Gateway** ‚Äì Acts as the API Gateway
- **Spring Cloud Config Server** ‚Äì Centralized configuration management
- **Eureka Server** ‚Äì Service discovery and registration
- **Spring Security + JWT** ‚Äì For secure authentication and authorization
- **FeignClient** ‚Äì For simplified and declarative inter-service communication
- **MySQL** ‚Äì As relational databases for persistent storage
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerization of all services
- **Kubernetes (Minikube)** ‚Äì Local orchestration and deployment of services

## üß© System Architecture

- **Microservices**: Each core domain (e.g., user, account, transaction) is built as an independent Spring Boot microservice.
- **API Gateway**: All external requests are routed through the Spring Cloud Gateway for security and routing.
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka Server allows services to register themselves and discover each other dynamically.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized via Spring Cloud Config Server, with support for dynamic config updates.
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication handled through Spring Security.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Implemented using FeignClient for clean, declarative, and synchronous REST communication between microse
- **Deployment**: Each service is Dockerized and deployed to a **local Minikube Kubernetes cluster** for orchestration and scalability testing.
